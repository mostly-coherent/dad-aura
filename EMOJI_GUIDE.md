## How to Send from Apple Watch

### Method 1: Text Message (Easiest!)
1. Open Messages on your watch
2. Select Dad's contact
3. Dictate or scribble your message:
   - "🔥 +10" or just "🔥"
   - "💩 -5" or just "💩"
   - Add a note: "🔥 +10 Great pancakes!"

### Method 2: Custom Points
Want to give MORE or LESS points? Just add the number:
- "🔥 +20" (double awesome!)
- "💩 -10" (extra disappointed)
- "⚡ +50" (ULTRA legendary)

## Examples

### Good Examples ✅

### Won't Work ❌
